Collection of route-level minibus taxi fares in Gauteng

The price data is sourced from route-level prices advertised at Taxi ranks, as well as information shared by taxi associations with the Tshwane regional SANTACO office. This data is collected in three ways. Firstly, through an online search on Twitter and Facebook for the terms "taxi fare" accompanied by the taxi association name. Often commuters share taxi prices on social media. Secondly, through written requests to SANTACO, the organizing body responsible for representing most taxi associations in negotiations with municipalities and government bodies, I obtained current prices for all Tshwane associations and some Johannesburg based associations. Finally, a fieldworker visited the main taxi ranks in the Johannesburg region and took photos of route level fares advertised at ranks. In this process, I obtained route-level prices of 92 taxi associations and over 2200 specific taxi routes in Gauteng.
